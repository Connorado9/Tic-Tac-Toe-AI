# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI
Whether drawn with chalk on the playground cement, with crayons on the kid’s menu before dinner, or waiting just about anywhere with a piece of scratch paper, many of us might remember playing the childhood game of Tic Tac Toe. To recap the basic rules, Tic Tac Toe is a strategy game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line wins the game. If neither player has a line of letters when the grid is filled, the game is a draw. The purpose of this project is to utilize Python to design an interactive game of Tic Tac Toe where a user plays against a simple Artificial Intelligence (AI) that can skillfully respond to the other player’s moves.
